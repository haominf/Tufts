~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~THIS IS A README FILE~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Purpose of the program:
    To simulate a real life problem of the operations of an order processing 
    facility for a top online retailer, Nozama Online.
    In the program, we have two main tasks listed below:
    (1) Retrieving an order
    (2) Packing an order
    After processing all the order information, the program will print out 
    the orders in the order they ship in a output file.

Files Provided:
    Parser.cpp
        This is the implementation of Parser class declaration provided by Mark 
        Sheldon.
    string2int.cpp
        This is the implementation of string2int() function provided by Mark
        Sheldon.
    Order.h
        This is the header file of Order struct provided by Mark Sheldon.
        (One element of int total_time is added by Haomin Feng)
    Orderqueue.cpp  
        This is the implementation of Orderqueue class. In Orderqueue class, a
        dynamic sequence is created to store Order structs, aka an array of
        Orders.
    Retrieve.cpp
        This is the implementation of Retrieve class. In Retrieve class, we can 
        call functions from Orderqueue class to place an order in the retrieving
        queue or remove an order if the fetcher is done fetching.
    Packer.cpp
        This is the implementation of Packer class. Similar to Retrieve class, 
        we can call functions from Orderqueue class to place an order in the 
        packing queue or remove an order if the packer is done packing.
    Operation.cpp
        This is the implementation of Operation class. Operation class acts as 
        a controlling center. It keeps track of the time step and the 
        workers available time (worker_timer) process order information, and 
        then coordinate between Retrive class and Packer class to get the orders
        done.
    * and all above's headerfiles

File Connections:
    Parse, Order, Orderqueue, Retrieve, and Packer are all subsets of Operations
    Orderqueue is subset of Retrieve and Packer
    Order is subset of Orderqueue
