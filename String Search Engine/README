~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~THIS IS A README FILE~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Purpose of the program:
    This program is to index and search a file tree for strings. It traverses a 
    file tree created using a module that is provided, anf then indexes each 
    file that it finds in the tree. After indexing all of the files, it enters a
    command loop to modify the search, and to quit the program.

Files Provided:
    gerp.cpp
        This is the main() of the program, which coordinates all the different 
        Classes and functions.
    FSTraversal.cpp
        This includes the functions that are used to traverse a file tree and 
        read in and store the data from the file in a Hashing Class.
    FSTraversal.h
        The function declaration of the FSTraversal.cpp,
    ReadFile.cpp
        This is the implementation of the ReadFile Class. This Class is used to 
        open a file and then read in lines and parse the lines into single
        words, and finally store them into a hash table and a vector in a 
        Hashing Class.
    ReadFile.cpp
        The header file of the ReadFile Class.
    Hashing.cpp
        This is the implementation of the Hashing Class. This Class is used to
        index every word from the file into a hash table and index the file into
        a vector. Chaining is used in the hash table, after the load factor gets
        to a certain value, we will expand(resize) the hash table.
    Hashing.h
        The header file of the Hashing.cpp. It includes the declaration of the 
        Hashing Class and two Structs.
    Search.cpp
        This is the implementation of the Search Class. This Class is used to 
        search a specific word in the hash table, and then print out the 
        info of the word.
    Search.h
        The header file of the Search Class.
    FSTree.o, FSTree.h, DirNode.o, DirNode.h

How to compile and run:
    Type "make" to compile
    Program will be started from the command line like this:
    ./gerp DirectoryToIndex
    Once the program indexes the specified directory it will print "Query? " 
    and wait for a command from the user. 

Architectural Overview:
    FSTraversal.cpp takes an instance of the ReadFile Class to open a file and 
    index its content.
    ReadFile Class takes a pointer to the Hashing Class to index and store the
    data in the Hashing Class's hash table and vector.
    Search Class takes a pointer to the Hashing Class to find the data stored in
    the hash table and the vector of the Hashing Class.
    FSTree implementation keeps a pointer to the the root DirNode.

Data Structures and Algorithms:
    Hash Table and STL vectors are the main data structures in this program.
    Chaining was used to create the hash table. It is fast and simple to index 
    a data by using a hash table. 
    This program has two main parts, which are traversing the tree and storing
    the data, and searching the data.

    1)First, traverse the file tree and find each file with the module provided.
    After it finds a file, open the file by using an instance of the ReadFile 
    Class. The ReadFile Class will open the file, read the content line by line.
    Everytime it reads one line, store that line into the array of lines in a 
    File Struct. And then parse the line into words, hash each word by using the
    Hashing Class, create a Word Struct for each word, and store the Word Struct
    into a hash table for words. After finishing reading all the file content, 
    store the File Sturct into a vector of Files inside the Hashing Class. The 
    index of the File Struct inside the File vector is stored in its related 
    Word Struct. So it will take constant time to find the file inside the
    vector with the matching word value.
    *Note, if (the number of elements in the hash table) / (the size of the 
    hash table) is larger than the load factor, do the table expansion. 

    2)Then, after finishing indexing all the files and data. It's time to search
    a specific word in the hash table with its related file. For sensitive 
    search, we take the hash value of the query to find the index of the buckets
    and then traverse the chain of that bucket to find the mathing words.
    Then use the matched Word Struct to find the position of the File struct.
    For insensitive search, first we convert the word into lower case, and then 
    convert the value in each bucket to lower case as well when traversing, if 
    two lower case values match each other, print out the result.
    * Note that to cater for insensitive case, when indexing the words, we 
    convert all the words in lower case, so it and its lower case equivalent can
    have the same index number, thus making the search easier.

    * Hash Table is made by a 2D vectors.
    vector< vector<Word> > 
    * a vector of Word Structs is declared as
    vector<Words>
    (Word and File are both Structs)

Testing:
    I finished the Hashing Class first, so I firstly tested the indexing and 
    storing of a word. I printed out all the data inside the vectors to see if 
    the results were right.
    Then I tested ReadFile Class to see if it could successfully read in a file 
    and then store data into the Hasing Class.
    Afer I finished the Search Class, I tested the whole program to see
    1) if it can find all the paths of a random word in both sensitive and 
    insensitive cases
    2) if only one line is printed when the same word appears more than one time
    in one line (both sensitive and insensitive cases)
    3) if it will print out word not found when there is no match in the hash 
    table
    4) if it can quit the program properly
    5) if it can handle large data sets
    6) if it can end the program when it reaches the end of the cin.
   
Things that have been improved since last provide:
    1) Stored the File Struct in a vector, and stored the index of the File in 
    the Word Struct, instead of storing File Struct in a hash table. When we
    know the index of the File in the vector, search time will be constant.
    2) Expanded the hash table. so when it gets more data, the chaining wont be 
    long.
